## Here is my code:
This code is a solution for tha [KATA](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54e8c3e89e2ae6f4900005a1/javascript) on Codewars: 

_Your task is to add a new property usersAnswer to every object in the array questions. The value of usersAnswer should be set to null. The solution should work for array of any length._
```
        function addProp(arr) {
          for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
            arr[i].usersAnswer = null;
          }
          return arr;
        }
```
